	* src/rat/gwp.py:
	Corrected the FileChooser problems in the correct way, which means that
	gwp.Data is aware of lazy getters, use the keyword 'is_lazy' and set it
	to 'True' when creating it.
	Improved documentation.
	Reworked on bits of gwp.Data.
	Corrected the file_chooser_button.
	Now uses gwp.OutOfSyncError to point possible gwp.Data problems.

	* src/rat/hig.py:
	Improved documentation.
	'humanize_seconds' now supports the optional display of hours and days.
